## Introduction
In the first week I had to setup enviroment and download required libraries. For example:
- conda,
- docker.
I use a virtual machine with Lubuntu. Then I got to know MLOps Maturity Model. We can divide this model into 5 parts:
- No Automation,
- DevOps but no MLOps,
- Automated Training,
- Automated Model Deployment,
- Full MLOps Automated Operations.

There is a [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model) to Microsoft description of this model.

After this steps I did a simple project with NY tripdata. The solution is in 01-Intro directory.
